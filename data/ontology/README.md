This folder will be used to store all pre-loaded ontologies.

Certain ontologies can only be access by authorised users (e.g. UMLS).

To verify you have the appropiate permission(s) you will need to login to the ontology account (e.g. your UMLS account to access UMLS) within Markup.

It can take a few minutes to download and setup the ontology the first time you authorise access to one within the local version of Markup.
